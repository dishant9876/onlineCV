        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>A web developer or is someone who takes a web design – which has been created by either a client or a design team – and turns it into a website. They do this by writing of complicated code, using a variety of
          languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.</p>
