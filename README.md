✅ Here are some **epic descriptions specifically for a GitHub Wiki-based documentation/knowledge system**:

---

### 🧩 1. **Epic – Setup and Publish GitHub Wiki for Project Documentation**

> Create and publish a structured GitHub Wiki to serve as the central documentation hub for the project. Organize content into clear sections such as Getting Started, Architecture, Developer Guide, API Reference, and FAQs. Ensure proper linking between pages, consistent formatting using Markdown, and alignment with the project’s repository.

---

### 📖 2. **Epic – Migrate Existing Documentation to GitHub Wiki**

> Migrate all existing documentation (from Confluence, Google Docs, or other sources) into the project’s GitHub Wiki. Refactor content into a standard hierarchy, remove outdated information, and add missing sections like Contribution Guidelines and Code Standards.

---

### 🌐 3. **Epic – Automate Wiki Updates with CI/CD**

> Automate the process of keeping the GitHub Wiki in sync with codebase changes using CI/CD pipelines. Include scripts to update version numbers, API changes, and changelogs in the Wiki automatically as part of release workflows.

---

### 🧭 4. **Epic – Enhance Wiki Usability & Search**

> Improve the usability of the GitHub Wiki by adding a clear table of contents, tags, and backlinks. Integrate a search functionality (via a browser extension or hosted mirror) to allow users to easily find relevant content.

---

### 🧪 5. **Epic – Add Diagrams and Examples to Wiki**

> Enhance the GitHub Wiki with architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and real-world examples. Use tools like Mermaid.js for diagrams and embed code snippets and screenshots for clarity.

---

### 🚀 6. **Epic – Multilingual Wiki**

> Enable multilingual support in the GitHub Wiki by maintaining separate sections or pages for different languages, catering to a global developer audience.

### 🚀 7. - Smart Home Automation**

  >Overview & Context
  With advancements in IoT (Internet of Things) technologies and the increasing adoption of connected devices in households, there is a growing demand for seamless and intelligent home automation solutions. Modern consumers share a strong preference for convenience, energy efficiency, and enhanced security within their homes. A truly effective smart home automation platform should empower homeowners to centrally manage multiple connected devices (lighting, security systems, thermostats, entertainment systems, appliances, etc.) and create customized automation scenarios that fit their unique lifestyles.
  The current market landscape features disparate ecosystems and varying degrees of interoperability, often resulting in a fragmented user experience. Our goal is to deliver a unified smart home automation system that is device-agnostic, secure, user-friendly, and scalable.
  Epic Description
  As a homeowner, I want to automate, control, and monitor a wide range of smart devices and household systems through a single, intuitive platform, so I can maximize home security, comfort, convenience, and energy savings, both locally and remotely. 
  Business Value / Rationale
  Enhances daily convenience by enabling automated routines and voice-activated controls.
  Improves home security with real-time monitoring and proactive alerts.
  Drives energy efficiency through intelligent management of lighting, climate, and appliances.
  Consolidates control of diverse brands/devices, creating a seamless consumer experience.
  Enables new revenue streams through value-added services and integrations.
  Detailed Acceptance Criteria
  The system integrates with a broad array of popular smart devices and platforms (e.g., Philips Hue, Nest, Ring, Zigbee, Z-Wave).
  End-users can control their home environment via web interface, mobile app, and/or voice assistant integration (Alexa, Google Home, Siri).
  Provides support for creating and managing automation routines (e.g., "If motion is detected after 11 PM, turn on hallway lights and send an alert"; "Turn off all devices when nobody is home").
  Offers a dashboard displaying real-time status and logs of all connected devices.
  Notifies users via push, SMS, or email about important events (e.g., security breach, smoke detected, doors left open).
  Implements robust security features: encrypted communication, secure onboarding of new devices, user authentication and access controls.
  Easily supports addition/removal of devices with minimal technical knowledge required.
  Supports user profiles, zones (rooms), and role-based access (e.g., owner, family, guest).
  Example User Stories (This Epic May Be Decomposed Into):
  As a homeowner, I want to securely connect all my compatible devices to a single platform, so I can monitor and control them in one place.
  As a user, I want to create automation routines (scenarios), so that devices respond intelligently to triggers and time schedules.
  As a homeowner, I want to receive immediate alerts if security sensors (doors, windows, cameras) detect unusual activity.
  As a household member, I want to adjust lighting, temperature, and entertainment settings remotely from my phone or tablet.
  As a guest, I want limited temporary access to certain smart devices (e.g., front door lock, thermostat) for the duration of my stay.
  As a user, I want to see an activity log (audit trail) of automation triggers and device states for troubleshooting or security purposes.
  As a homeowner, I want to integrate voice control for hands-free operation of key devices and routines.
