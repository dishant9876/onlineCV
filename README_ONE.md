1. Introduction
Registering your app with the AppX Platform enables seamless integration with AppX’s API and related services. This document provides an exhaustive guide on how to register your app, configure required permissions, generate client secrets, and integrate securely with AppX’s ecosystem.

2. Why Register Your App?
API Access: Gain secure, authenticated access to AppX APIs.
Brand Recognition: Display your app name and icon to users.
Permission Management: Users can see what data your app will access.
Security Compliance: Use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect best practices.
Analytics: Access app usage and performance metrics.
3. Prerequisites
AppX Platform account (personal or organization)
App name, logo & description
Knowledge of your app’s required API permissions
Redirect URI(s) for OAuth/OpenID Connect flows
Valid email address for notifications
4. Step 1: Creating an AppX Account
If you already have an account, skip to Section 5.

a) Visit the Registration Page

| Support Email:            | support@myfinancetracker.com |
+---------------------------+
8. Step 5: Specifying Redirect URIs
Add your app’s OAuth 2.0 redirect URIs.

URI Type	Example
Web	https://myfinancetracker.com/callback
Mobile	myfinancetracker://callback
Local Dev	http://localhost:3000/callback
Use HTTPS for all production URIs.
You can list multiple URIs.
9. Step 6: Selecting Permissions (Scopes)
Choose the specific APIs and data your app requires. Less is more — only request what you need.

Permission	Description
user:profile	Read user’s name, avatar
user:email	Access user’s email address
finances:read	View user’s finances
finances:write	Modify user’s finances
Example Scope Selection UI:

[ ] user:profile
[x] user:email
[x] finances:read
[ ] finances:write
10. Step 7: Generating and Managing Client Secrets
AppX issues Client ID and Client Secret. Never share the secret code publicly.

Upon submission:

Key	Example Value
Client ID	dfb7c7b0-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-c307d5e4db4a
Secret	abc123DEF456ghIJ789KLmnoPQrsTUVwxyZ
Note:
Download your client secret and store it securely. You’ll not be able to retrieve it later!

11. Step 8: Configuring Branding and App Icon
Upload an icon. Recommended size: 512x512px, PNG or SVG.

Set a color theme to match your brand.

App name & icon will be displayed in all user consent dialogs.
12. Step 9: Adding Platform Configurations
Specify where your app will run:

Web (enter allowed domains)
iOS (enter Bundle Identifier)
Android (enter Package Name, SHA-1 fingerprint)
Desktop (allowed origins)
13. Step 10: Completing Registration
Review all your settings.
Check for typos or invalid domains.
Click “Submit Registration”.
You will see:

Your application “MyFinanceTracker” has been successfully registered.

14. Step 11: Post-Registration Steps
a) Verification
You may need to verify domain ownership (instructions provided by AppX).

b) Edit App Registration
You can update app info, redirect URIs, and branding anytime via the Developer Console.

c) Submit for Verification (Optional)
For public/production apps, submit your app for AppX review. This is required for requesting sensitive scopes.

15. Step 12: AppX API Integration
a) Using OAuth 2.0
Integrate the issued Client ID and redirect URI in your OAuth flow.

Sample (JavaScript/Node.js Example):

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/auth/appx', (req, res) => {
  const client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';
  const redirect_uri = 'https://myfinancetracker.com/callback';
  const scope = 'user:email finances:read';
  const url = `https://api.appx.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=${client_id}&redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(redirect_uri)}&scope=${scope}`;
  res.redirect(url);
});
b) Handling the Callback
After authorization, AppX redirects to your callback URI with a code.

app.get('/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code } = req.query;
  // Exchange code for tokens here
});
c) Token Exchange
Use your client credentials to exchange the code for an access/refresh token.

16. Security Best Practices
Never expose your client secret in public repositories.
Always use HTTPS for redirect URIs.
Monitor API usage and revoke credentials if compromised.
Rotate secrets regularly.
Restrict IPs/domains if possible.
17. Troubleshooting Registration Issues
Issue	Solution
Invalid Redirect URI	Check case, protocol (HTTPS), trailing slashes, and spelling
Invalid Client ID/Secret	Re-generate in the Developer Console
Permission Error	Add missing scope under app registration
Icon Upload Fails	Check file size, format (PNG/SVG), image resolution
Missing Verification Email	Check spam/junk folder; resend verification
Domain Verification Fails	Ensure DNS TXT record or HTML file is correctly placed
18. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
